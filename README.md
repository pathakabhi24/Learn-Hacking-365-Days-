# Learn365

This repository contains all the information shared during my Learn 365 days Challenge. Learn 365 is a challenge to keep the learning spirit going on and challenge myself to learn something daily for the whole year, it can be anything from infosec to general life. 
Follow me on Twitter for Regular Updates: [Abhinav Pathak](https://twitter.com/i_amsphinx). That type of stuffs are shared by some people on the Internet but they share some Intermediate and Advanced steps of Hacking. I thought I can do this for Beginners who want to make career in this field. So this challenge will help them.
